# Task 14: Linux Server Hardening & Secure Configuration

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **hardening a Linux server** by applying security best practices to reduce attack surface, prevent unauthorized access, and protect system integrity.  
The implementation follows the **principle of least privilege**, secure service configuration, and continuous monitoring.

The goal is to demonstrate practical Linux security skills commonly required in **system administration, SOC, and cybersecurity roles**.

## What Is Server Hardening?
Server hardening means protecting your Linux server by reducing its vulnerability surface. It’s like locking every door and window of your house before you go on vacation. You remove unnecessary services, close open ports, and implement security best practices to ensure your server stays safe from intruders.

## Why It Matters?
Even though Linux is considered more secure than many other operating systems, it’s not immune to attacks. Poor configurations, outdated software, or weak passwords can make your server an easy target.


## 1️⃣ Review Default System Settings
Understand the system before making changes.

``bash
### Check OS version
` lsb_release -a`

### List users
`cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd`

### List running services
`systemctl list-units --type=service`

### Check open ports
`ss -tuln`

## 2️⃣ User Account Hardening

- Remove unused users and restrict privileges.

### Delete unused user
`sudo userdel -r username`

### View sudo users
`getent group sudo`


###Edit sudo access:

`sudo visudo`


   ✔ Apply least privilege
   ✔ Avoid using root for daily tasks

## 3️⃣ Secure SSH Configuration

- Disable root login and enforce key-based authentication.

`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`


## Update the following:

```
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```


### Restart SSH:

`sudo systemctl restart ssh`


Why? Prevent brute-force and credential-based attacks.

4️⃣ Update System & Enable Automatic Security Updates
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades -y
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades


✔ Keeps system patched
✔ Reduces known vulnerabilities

5️⃣ Configure Firewall (UFW)
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose


Result: Only essential network traffic is allowed.

6️⃣ Disable Unnecessary Services
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service


Disable unused services:

sudo systemctl disable servicename
sudo systemctl stop servicename


✔ Reduces attack surface
✔ Improves system performance

7️⃣ Secure File Permissions

Protect sensitive system files.

# Secure shadow file
sudo chmod 640 /etc/shadow

# Secure SSH directory
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


Goal: Prevent unauthorized file access.

8️⃣ Log Monitoring & Auditing
# View authentication logs
sudo cat /var/log/auth.log

# Check system logs
sudo journalctl -xe


(Optional) Install auditing tools:

sudo apt install auditd -y


✔ Detect suspicious activity
✔ Improve incident response

9️⃣ Security Auditing with Lynis
sudo apt install lynis -y
sudo lynis audit system


Lynis provides:
